The students will learn and practice their NLP and ML knowledge and skills by reviewing and discussing state of the art literature and developing individual real world projects.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Course Details\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\n* Professor: Dr. Paul Anderson\r\n* Office: 313 HWEA\r\n* Office Hours: My door is always open. Even if it isn't, please knock. I always love to hear from students. I have a little sign that I try to keep up in the window to show when I am in the office.\r\n* E-mail: andersonpe2@cofc.edu\r\n* Office Phone: 843-953-8151\r\n* Facebook: andersonpe2@cofc.edu\r\n\r\n### Course (learning) outcomes\r\n\r\n* Apply natural language processing and machine learning in a real world project\r\n* Work in a group setting to practice software engineering\r\n* Communicate state of the art literature\r\n\r\n### Grading Policy\r\n\r\n* Weekly Blog - 40%\r\n* Literature discussion and presentation - 20%\r\n* Programming Contribution (GitHub Commits) - 40%\r\n\r\nGrading Scale: A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: <65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the discretion of the instructor.\r\n\r\nGrading Guidelines: Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy and reference below).\r\n\r\n* The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.\r\n* The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and medium-level achievement in the other.\r\n* The grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and medium-level achievement in the others.\r\n* The grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.\r\n\r\nReference: Errol Thompson, Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Jacqueline L.

During that time we will have a weekly presentation by each person of a paper from the literature. The rest of the time will be used to discuss and work on the project.\r\n\r\n### Programming Assignments\r\n\r\nA programming grade will be assigned at the end of the class based on your GitHub commits.\r\n\r\n### Honor Code\r\n\r\nYou must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).\r\nYou must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.\r\nIn any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.\r\nAlso see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.\r\nClassroom Policies\r\n\r\nYou are expected to take good notes during class.\r\nYou are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.\r\nYou are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (>= 3) absences. If you miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office; also, you are responsible for announcements made in class, assignment due dates, etc.\r\nYou should turn off all electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, pagers, etc.).\r\nIn summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).\r\nLate Policy\r\n\r\nNo late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.\r\n\r\n### Classroom Policies\r\n* You are expected to take good notes during class.\r\n* You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.\r\n* You are expected to attend all classes.

We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.\r\n</p>",
