This course teaches core Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) concepts and techniques that are important for developing automatic text processing applications related to predictive modeling. The students will learn and practice their NLP and ML knowledge and skills by reviewing and discussing state of the art literature and developing individual real world projects.

<ul>
<li>The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.</li>
<li>The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and medium-level achievement in the other.</li>

<h3>
<a id="lecture-style" class="anchor" href="#lecture-style" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lecture Style</h3>

<p>There will be no lectures in this course. We will meet once a week. During that time we will have a weekly presentation by each person of a paper from the literature. The rest of the time will be used to discuss and work on the project.</p>

<h3>
<a id="programming-assignments" class="anchor" href="#programming-assignments" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming Assignments</h3>

<p>A programming grade will be assigned at the end of the class based on your GitHub commits.</p>

<h3>
<a id="blog" class="anchor" href="#blog" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog</h3>

<p>You must document what you have spent your time on each week in a blog. Specifically, you must show how you have spent 6-10 hours a week on the course outside of class.</p>

<h3>
<a id="honor-code" class="anchor" href="#honor-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Honor Code</h3>

<p>You must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).
You must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.
In any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.
Also see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.
Classroom Policies</p>

<p>You are expected to take good notes during class.
You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.
You are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (&gt;= 3) absences. If you miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office; also, you are responsible for announcements made in class, assignment due dates, etc.
You should turn off all electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, pagers, etc.).
In summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).
Late Policy</p>

<p>No late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.</p>

The Anderson Data Science Research Lab specializes in applying data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, and metabolomics. We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.
